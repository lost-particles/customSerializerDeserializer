## Summary
> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered

My implementation comprises `<number>` software components, totaling `<number>` lines of code. Key challenges included `<1, 2, 3 + how you solved them>`.

## Correctness & Performance Characterization
> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation

*Correcness*: I wrote `<number>` tests; these tests take `<time>` to execute. This includes objects with `<certain kinds of features>`.

*Performance*: Evaluating serialization and deserialization on objects of varying sizes using [high-resolution timers](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html) results in the following table:

|               | Serialization | Deserialization |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 100 elems     | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| 1000 elems    | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| 10000 elems   | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| 100 funcs     | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| 1000 funcs    | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| 10000 funcs   | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| 1000 cyles    | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| native objects| `<time>`      | `<time>`        |
| ...           | `<time>`      | `<time>`        |

## Time to Complete
> Roughly, how many hours did this milestone take you to complete?

Hours: `<time>`

## Wild Guess
> This assignment made a few simplifying assumptions — for example, it does not attempt to support the entire language. How many lines of code do you think it would take to support other features? (If at all possible, try to justify your answer — even a rough justification about the order of magnitude and its correlation to missing features is enough.)

FLoC: `<guess a number>`
